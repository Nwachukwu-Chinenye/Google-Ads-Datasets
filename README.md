# Google-Ads-Datasets
This repository contains two versions of a Google Ads dataset:
- **Google Ads.cleaned.xlsx**: The cleaned version, processed using Excel to correct formats (e.g., Ad_Date to YYYY-MM-DD), fix errors (e.g., Conversion Rate as Conversions / Clicks), and handle some missing values.
- **GoogleAds_DataAnalytics_Sales_Uncleaned.csv**: The original, raw dataset with potential inconsistencies (e.g., misspellings like "data anaytics training") and missing data.
