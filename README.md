# Google-Ads-Datasets
This repository contains two versions of a Google Ads dataset:
Google Ads.cleaned.xlsx: The cleaned version of the dataset, processed using Excel to correct formats and remove errors.
GoogleAds_DataAnalytics_Sales_Uncleaned.csv: The original, raw dataset as it was collected.

#About the Data
This dataset includes Google Ads metrics such as clicks, impressions, conversions, and other performance indicators. The data was collected for a Data Analytics Course campaign in Hyderabad, covering November 2024. The cleaned version (Google Ads.cleaned.xlsx) was processed using Excel to standardize formats (e.g., Ad_Date to YYYY-MM-DD) and fix errors (e.g., Conversion Rate calculations), making it ready for analysis.

#Notes
The cleaned file (Google Ads.cleaned.xlsx) is formatted for easy analysis in tools like Excel, Python, or R.
The uncleaned file (GoogleAds_DataAnalytics_Sales_Uncleaned.csv) preserves the original state of the data, including potential inconsistencies or errors (e.g., misspellings like "data anaytics training"), and can be used for reference or further cleaning.
If the uncleaned file contains sensitive data, consider anonymizing it before use.
