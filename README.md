Google-Ads-Datasets
This repository contains two versions of a Google Ads dataset:
Google Ads.cleaned.xlsx: The cleaned version of the dataset, processed using Excel to correct formats and remove errors.
GoogleAds_DataAnalytics_Sales_Uncleaned.csv: The original, raw dataset with potential inconsistencies (e.g., misspellings like "data anaytics training") and missing data.

About the Data
Source: Collected from Google Ads campaigns in Hyderabad, India, covering November 2024.
Metrics: Includes clicks, impressions, conversions, conversion rate, cost, leads, sale amount, ad date, location, device, and keyword.
Cleaning Process: The cleaned file was processed using Excel on July 30, 2025, to standardize data and improve usability for analysis.

Usage
Cleaned File: Use Google Ads.cleaned.xlsx for immediate analysis in Excel, Python (with pandas), or R.
Uncleaned File: Use GoogleAds_DataAnalytics_Sales_Uncleaned.csv for reference or to replicate the cleaning process.
Tools: Open with spreadsheet software or data analysis tools.

Notes
The cleaned file contains 2,601 rows with standardized formats, while the uncleaned file retains the original 2,601 rows.
Missing values (e.g., clicks, cost) are partially addressed in the cleaned version; further imputation may be needed.
If the uncleaned file contains sensitive data, anonymize it before sharing.
